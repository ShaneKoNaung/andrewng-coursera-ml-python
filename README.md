This is Python Implementation of programming assignments in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Coursera course

I used numpy, pandas to implement this. I just finished exercise 1. I think I'm gonna keep using these two.
Fow now, I haven't added visualizations needed for the exercises. I just coded in a python script.
I might add them later.

If you find bugs, please do me a favor and let me know.
